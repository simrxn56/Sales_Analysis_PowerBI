# Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
## Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to understand overall business performance, product profitability, customer segments, and regional trends.
The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that answers common business questions and supports basic decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset contains order-level retail data including:
- Order date
- Product category and sub-category
- Sales and profit
- Customer segment
- Region

(Data is stored in the `/data` folder.)

## Business Questions
- The dashboard is designed to help answer:
- How are sales and profit trending over time?
- Which product categories and sub-categories are most and least profitable?
- Which customer segments contribute the most revenue?
- Are there products with high sales but low profit?
- Which regions perform better or worse in terms of profit?

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, and Profit Margin
- Sales trend over time using line chart
- Profit by product sub-category (sorted bar chart)
- Sales by product category and top products
- Sales by customer segment
- Scatter plot showing Sales vs Profit by sub-category to analyze profitability vs volume
- Region-wise profit distribution
- Interactive filters for region, category, and customer segment

## Key Insights
- Technology category generates high sales, but some sub-categories show weak profit margins.
- Corporate customers contribute the largest share of total sales.
- Certain products have high revenue but low profit, indicating potential pricing or cost issues.
- Profit varies significantly by region, suggesting scope for regional strategy optimization.
